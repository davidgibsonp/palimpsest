## The Problem

```bash
Developer: "How did I fix that async timeout issue last month?"
AI: "I don't remember your previous conversations..."
Developer: *scrolls through 47 chat histories* 😵‍💫
```

## The Solution

What if your AI coding assistant could learn from every session you've ever had?

Palimpsest captures the traces of your AI collaboration sessions. The breakthrough moments. The dead ends. The "aha!" discoveries.

**Your debugging wisdom, preserved.**
